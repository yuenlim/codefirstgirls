   <p> The London Underground or most commonly known as “The Tube”
      can be a daunting and terrifying experience for tourists.
      At first glance,the senses are immediately overwhelmed with the
      sight of hundreds of commuters power walking
      through, the loud roar of the train pulling into
      the station, the beeping sound of the ticket gates
      and worst of all… the humidity of being underground.
      Fear not, we have compiled this list with 10 tips
      that will guarantee you will have a pleasant trip! </p>

<ol class="custom-counter">
  <li>Mind the gap. This is the first rule of navigating through the London Underground and one that is ominously blared through the tannoys. The phrase has since become a cultural symbol of the tube. </li>
  <li>Grab onto one of the many poles to steady your balance. Leaning on your fellow passengers is considered weirdly intimate and awkward for all parties involved and you will be met with a sideways glance and an audible sigh. </li>
  <li>Plan ahead and purchase a visitor Oyster card. These are smartcards that can be loaded with credit and is generally cheaper than buying paper tickets.  </li>
  <li>Stand on the right side on the escalator. Take the time to notice the signs that subtly remind passengers to stand on the right and walk on the left otherwise havoc will ensue. </li>
  <li>Offer your seat to someone in need regardless if you are sat in the priority seat or not. Usually, they will be wearing an issued badge that indicates their need for a seat. </li>
  <li>Remove your backpack/large handbag before boarding the train unless you want to barged as people attempt to slither past you. You are warned!</li>
  <li>Allow passengers to exit the train before boarding. Don’t fear, you WILL board the train!</li>
  <li>Avoid small talk. Whilst Londoners excel in small talk about the weather, there’s a time and a place for it and the tube is not one of these times. Instead we prefer to read a book or the complimentary newspaper, listen to music and/or daydream about nothing in particular.</li>
  <li>Don't eat offensively smelly food. There’s nothing worse than being in a confined space whilst the person sat next to you is ravaging a tikka masala curry. </li>
  <li>Beware of standing in the middle of a staircase or pathway to consult your tube map. The tube is a constant stream of people power walking to their next destination in perfect unison. Interrupting this flow can cause a few glares, sighs and tutting from other passengers. Find a safe spot to peruse the map for directions.</li>
